# Bootstrap-website

### The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic understanding of bootstrap.

This is a simple website built using only Bootstrap and CSS. 

### Perfect example of a website built using Bootstrap:

* Simple Bootstrap projects with source code.
* Getting introduced to some underrated and quite useful tags.
* Project to practice.

## Getting Started

#### Since this is an example project, I'd encourage you to clone and rename this project to use for your own purposes. It's a good starter boilerplate.

* Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
* Open the index.html file in your preferred browser to view the website.
* Explore the code by opening the file in a text editor and following the comments.
